# Data Analysis Portfolio: Exploring Python and Telling Stories Through Code.
<hr>

## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio! Here you’ll find various sample notebooks and projects that I’m working on. My goal here is to not only outline my skills and interests but also to explore Python through data analysis.

You might find that my style is non-traditional because I take the time to write about the topics I’m exploring. I believe that it is one thing to write good code, but to also tell a story adds so much value to a topic. This space is where I express myself through code and writing, both of which are skills I’m continuously improving. I strive to make my notebooks entertaining for the audience. If you’re a data or Python enthusiast, I hope you find something that interests you.

I’m dedicated to learning and growth, so there will be more to come.
